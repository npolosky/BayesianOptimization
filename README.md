# BayesianOptimization

This repository contains code which optimizes a function using Gaussian Process Regression. The code uses the CMA-ES optimization algorithm to compute the next exploration point in the Gaussian Process.  

The example shows the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performing Gaussian Process Regression on a function which is a Morlet Wavelet in the first dimension and a simple bump function in the second dimension.
