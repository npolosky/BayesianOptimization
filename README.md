# BayesianOptimization

This repository contains code which optimizes a function using Gaussian Process Regression. The code currently depends on the pycma module as it uses the CMA-ES optimization algorithm to compute the next exploration point in the Gaussian Process.  

The example shows the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performing Gaussian Process Regression on a Morlet Wavelet Function.
